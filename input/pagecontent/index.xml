  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Implementation guides are the mechanism that FHIR uses to explain how to use the FHIR specification to achieve interoperability in a particular space.
    They use a variety of FHIR resources to express that guidance computably  and then allow those artifacts to be converted into a rendered form
    (typically as a web site) for easy understanding by software developers and others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Implementation guides can be written by anyone and a wide variety of tooling can be used to both define and publish such guides.  This implementation
    guide is an 'example' that shows how to use HL7-defined tools and templates to author and then render implementation guide content.  It also provides
    recommended practices for IG authoring, including suggestions around the organization of the implementation guide, how artifacts should be named and how
    content should be presented to maximize the usefulness of the guide for its target community.
  </p>
  <p>
    The documentation in this implementation guide is a work in progress.  The tooling used to support implementation guide creation and publication
    continues to change.  As well, the community continues to learn more about what constitutes "best practice" around implementation guide design and the
    documentation here will evolve to reflect any changes in guidance.

  <h3>Technical details</h3>
  <p>
    This implementation guide specifically documents the HL7 IG Publisher tool, the most recent version of which can be found <a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/releases/latest">here</a>.  It applies to all
    IGs that make use of HL7's IG base template.  This currently includes the following:

        <td>This template includes all of the scripts, layouts, etc. to produce an HL7-style implementation guide.  However, it does not include the HL7 or
        FHIR logos.  It is intended to serve as a base for most non-HL7 IG publications</td>
