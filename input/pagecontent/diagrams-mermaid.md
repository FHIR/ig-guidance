Mermaid diagrams can be included by placing diagram code in an element with `class="mermaid"`.

#### Introduction to Mermaid

Mermaid is a versatile scripting language that enables the creation of various types of diagrams through simple text definitions. Mermaid's simplicity and flexibility make it a popular choice for embedding visual representations directly within documentation or web pages.

For more detailed syntax and examples, the Mermaid [syntax reference guide](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/syntax-reference.html) and the interactive tool [Mermaid live editor](https://mermaid.live) are excellent resources. There are also plugins for popular editors like VS Code.

#### Diagram Types

Mermaid supports a range of diagram types, such as:

- **Flowcharts:** Visualize logical steps in a process.
- **Sequence Diagrams:** Detail interactions among parts within a system.
- **User Journeys:** Map out the path a user travels through a product.
- **Mindmaps:** Show the branching relationships between concepts or tasks.
- and many more...

#### Including Mermaid Diagrams in Your Documentation

To include a Mermaid diagram in your documentation, you simply need to place the diagram code within an HTML element with the class `mermaid`. Here is a simple example of an inline Mermaid diagram:

```html
<div class="mermaid">
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
</div>
```

If you're writing markdown, you can use a `<div>` as shown above, or you can use a <code>{% raw %}```mermaid{% endraw %}</code> code block like:

````markdown
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
````

It renders as:

<div class="mermaid">
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
</div>

In this example, the `div` element can be replaced with any other HTML element, as long as the `mermaid` class is included. During the webpage rendering process, any elements with the class `mermaid` will be automatically replaced with an SVG of the diagram described by the contained Mermaid code.

#### Practical Implementation

1. **Create the Diagram Code**: Write your Mermaid diagram code according to the syntax and diagram type you need.
2. **Embed in HTML**: Place your diagram code within an HTML element with the class `mermaid` as shown in the example above.
